 A very simple countdown timer for practicing Pecha Kucha presentations and their 20-second slides. Made this for my girlfriend to practice her presentation with.

 It should run on any MIDP2.0 J2ME phone though it probably could work on MIDP1.0 as well. I only tried it on my K750i.

 If you push the OK button or middle click with a joystick, it will reset back to 20. It just loops 20-second countdowns over and over.

 The GUI is also VERRRRY ghetto. Since J2ME doesn't have a font big enough for the large numbers I wanted, I created each number as a PNG using MS Paint. :)

To try it on your phone:

0. download the repo using the 'Download' link at the top of this GitHub project.
1. unzip/untar it.
2. copy the JAR file from deployed/DefaultColorPhone/pechakuchatimer.jar to your phone. either send it via Bluettoth or copy to a memory card or something
3. launch and install it on the phone
4. run it from the phone

Enjoy!
